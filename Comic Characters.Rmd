## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r Comic Characters}
devtools::install_github('diplodata/gtrendsR',force=T)
install.packages("reshape2")
install.packages("anytime")


library(gtrendsR)
library(reshape2)
library(anytime)

google.trends = gtrends(c("Superman","Batman","spiderman","Iron Man","Hulk"),gprop= c("web","news","images","froogle","youtube"),time ="today+5-y",category = "3")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r google.trends, echo=FALSE}
plot(google.trends)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
